## Personal Info
I am currently an undergraduate student in China. I majored in Big data, programming is my hobby.

I am interested in AI, including machine learning, data mining. 

My dream is to be a top hacker. Not a hacker in network security, but a hacker in a broad sense.

## Hacking Code
- Don't do things that are not fun
- Don't do things that don't reflect your IQ
- Don't do things without the spirit of exploration
